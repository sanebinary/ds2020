Practical Work 1: TCP File transfer
======
## **Protocol Design**
There are four essential stages when implementing the socket solution for transferring file data between server and client:

  * First, similar to the provided chat system, a connection has to be established by the client and accepted by the server listening in the ports first. IP of the server and the wanted filename are required. 
  * Second, the server receives the filename requested, opens the file and sends it to the client, only stops when the end of file is reached. If filename not existed, return some prompt to the client. The client on receiving the file, will loop until it reaches the EOF signal.
  * Three, in case it is the client which uploads the file, the server creates the filename as given. Start reading on the socket and writing to the file descriptor.
  * Four, close the connection. The server will continue listening for requests at designated ports.

Here are the details of the implementation:

### **Server:**
1. Similar to the chat system, the server uses socket, bind and listen functions to create a listening socket.
2. The socket is bound to port **11111**, its communication domain being set as **AF_INET** for **IPv4** protocol, communication type as **SOCK_STREAM** for TCP connection, protocol as 0 for IP. Moreover, it is bound to the special IP address **INADDR_ANY** which allows working without knowing the IP address of the machine, or in the case of a machine with multiple network interfaces, it allowes the server to receive packets destined to any of the interfaces.
3. The server waits for connection and for data to arrive over this connection. This call returns the number of bytes that is received.
4. The server opens the file which filename was obtained in the previous step.
5. a) The server transfers the content of the file. The function only stops when the entire file has been sent. 
5. b) In case the server is receiving the file, only stops when there are no longer data being passed through socket fd.
6. Continue listening for requests. 


### **Client:**
1. This client takes two parameters. The first parameter is the IPv4 address. The second parameter is the name of the file that the client attempts to obtain from the server. A server application sends the contents of the specified file to the client.
2. The client creates a socket. 
3. The client establishes a connection to the server.
4. The client informs the server what file name it wants to obtain.
5. a) The client goes into a loop reading from socket and writing until the EOF is reached. A return code of 0 on the buffer means that there are no more data and that the server closed the connection.
5. b) If the client is the one uploading the file, continuously read from file descriptor and write to socket until EOF is reached.
6. The client closes the socket.

### **Here is the figure for the design:**

## **Organize the system**

	In order to organize the system, FTP Server and FTP User are needed. In the FTP Server, we have Server PI and Server DTP while in FTP User are User DTP, User PI and User Interface. All factor inside of FTP Server and FTP User are connected to each others. The Server DTP is connected with User DTP via Data Connection while Server PI is connected with User PI via FTP Commands/ FTP Replies.  Given the limited budget, the server and the client is one the same machine. Therefore, it is crucial that the server and the client are different folder to avoid overwriting of existing files.
